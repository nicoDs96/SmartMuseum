# Design
This document is the second version of the design document for the SmartMuseum project. The first version is in the [hisory folder](history/Design.md). Changes to the original design reflect the fact that our first project was too simple in core feature provided, not strictly related to the IoT field and also to wide. Here we decided to only focus on the specific indoor environment monitoring feature. As in the frist project, since it was a strong point, the target is still very specific. In this document we revisit our target (that became musem curators only) and with a simple storyboard we illustrate what the product should offer.
